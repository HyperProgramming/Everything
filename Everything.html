        <h2>Dear Jodi,</h2>
        <p>This may be sudden for you, but i'll get straight to the point. I like you and it's not because we were shipped by our classmates. I've secretly liked you since Late September of 2024. You probably don't remember but i fell for you because you showed me kindness, even if it seemed the slightest bit of kindness it was the first time i was shown care from a girl.</p>
        <p><strong>Reasons why i like you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>At first i only noticed your looks (you wore yellow that time)</li>
            <h5>Short story muna dito, since i liked you that time, i got the opportunity to help get your eco runway dress to kimco (kasama ko si amir, ernest at russel para dalhin yun via grab car) and after ng event nag volunteer ako na ako nalang bahala sa dress since itatapon na pala yun. Ending neto inuwi ko at pinalabas ko na "itatapon ko" pero tinago ko sa budega. Kaso nga lang after a week wala ako sa bahay nun at nasama yung dress sa pagtapon sa basura since naka tago siya sa garbage bag. (biggest regret ong).</h5>
            <li>You showed me kindness</li>
            <h5>During late september, naniningil ka that time for props/choreo (can't remember which), i didn't expect na tatanongin mo muna ako na kung may pang bayad ba ako at kung wala pwede naman isabay ko nalang sa next na singil, yeah this may seem small but the fact you asked me that and not the others, i assumed that you're a caring person for me.</h5>
            <h5>Nov 30, bigla nagka karaoke sa discord and di ako confident sa boses ko especially after spoken poetry, after ng turn ko nag sorry na di ako marunong kumanta kasi bandang patapos na yung song marami na nagsi left ng call (iirc ikaw, ako, jersuran at eman nalang natira sa call). You saved me from overthinking by simply telling me, "Uy di kaya, galing mo kumanta" you may not remember saying this to me but i remember it really well.</h5>
            <h5>The thing that happened during late september happened again during march, naniningil ka para sa mga nagastos for basket making for cpar peta. After i gave my part, you told me "Okay lang ba ngayon ka mag bayad? May pamasahe ka pa ba?" again, it may seem little but you being kind to me will never fail to make me happy.</h5>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>(Lame) Reasons why i didn't make a move this entire time:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>I always doubt myself, i always tell myself i don't deserve you and that i should hope that you meet someone else worthy of your love.</li>
            <li>Pretty and kind as you are, i assumed you already had someone else hence i only admired you from a distance.</li>
            <li>I thought i was becoming a better person until Nov 20, spoken poetry came. I had the entire poem in my head and mid delivery i forgot everything. blank. I was given a second chance and i still blew it. I also saw you looking at the window so the defeat i felt that day was the hardest i've felt. I was sure that i don't deserve someone pretty and caring as you.</li>
            <li>I'm very fragile when it comes to health, i couldn't see myself at the time as someone who could protect you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Why i'm making my move now:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>During graduation, we got our duo pic. I thought, maybe i have a chance after all?</li>
            <li>A week after, we had an outing for swimming. I planned to make a move that day but everytime i try to approach, my mind goes blank and my body backs off. Upto the point the swimming session was over i made 0 moves. I overthinked about why i couldn't show any motive that i actually like you, until i suddenly felt dizzy, sat down, lost consiousness. (Yes, this was the one i shook off as dehydration because it felt too pathetic to tell everyone)</li>
            <li>A month prior to this website, while being in discord, they found out i actually like you and not because they shipped us. I forgot i was sharing my screen while scrolling ig.</li>
            <li>A few days ago, pinaalam ni cha sakin na may dump account ka at i-follow ko raw, nahiya ako i-follow syempre since baka i'd come off as weird since out of no where naman yung pag follow ko. Itutulog ko nalang dapat yun kaso naisip ko rin na "Wala naman siguro mawawala sakin kung i-follow ko diba..?", then few secs later habang nakatulala sa follow button sinabihan ako ni cha na "Tagal pag di mo i-ffollow i-ttag ko nalang si mahmah jods" eto na pipindutin na nga eh</li>
            <li>They're right, nothing will happen i don't make a move. I keep waiting for "the right time" but that's just another reason for me not to make a move. So i made this to let you know everything i feel.</li>
